Roasted maple, which has undergone a high-temperature heat treatment, not only gets improved resistance to the warping of the neck, but also has an advantage in sound quality.  Two Bacchus original humbucker pickups are used. The bridge humbucker is positioned closer to the bridge for a more aggressive and powerful tone. Even when distorted with distortion, there is a moderate sense of separation, making it ideal for heavy and modern genres.

A finish that accentuates the appeal of wood An -Antique Finish- that values the natural texture of the wood used as the material.
Because this is a guitar that you want to touch every day, we have created a color scheme that is soothing and never gets old, just like an exquisite piece of furniture.

Arch shape inherited from the Handmade Series
This model follows the arch shape of the original Japan-made Handmade Series DUKE model produced at the Aska factory. The curves of the arches add definition to the top of the body, which is the face of the guitar, and the reflections of the polished paint give it a beautiful, tight look.The set neck model’s playability and sound are affected by the angle of the neck. While reproducing the arch shape and neck angle of the Handmade Series DUKE model made in Japan, we fine-tuned it to match the material and design of the instrument. This has resulted in the best balance between the nice attack produced by the moderate tension and the rich body tone.

Deep joints for efficient vibration transmissionA deep-joint system is used, which has a large bonding area with the body and transmits vibration firmly. The wide ground contact width also has the advantage of making it easier to achieve accuracy in preparation angles and woodworking.

The thickness of the body has been adjusted and brought down to a range that doesn’t compromise the balance of the DUKE’s unique appearance while retaining all of the goodness in the sound profile. With this reduction in the body’s width, we succeeded in reducing the overall weight of the body, making it easier for even relatively small players to carry and maneuver.

Slim NeckThis model features our Slim U-shaped neck grip. Even players with relatively small hands can easily press down on the strings and concentrate on playing while your left hand can always easily change positions.

Original Pickups
Equipped with an original humbucker using a ferrite magnet with stable quality. It has a fatness and sweetness suitable for single-note riffs and solos, but also has a brightness that is easy to use for clean tones, making it useful in a variety of genres.

Setup by our own specialized inspection team in JapanAll instruments are inspected and set up by a specialized inspection team at the Deviser headquarters in Matsumoto City, Nagano Prefecture, before being shipped. By identifying individual differences in the material wood, we adjust and finish each instrument evenly to provide players with a solid playing experience that feels great and is ready to go right out of the box.

It features our latest CYGNUS X2 amp modeling, developed for the award-winning Axe-Fx III. The FM3 recreates the sound and the feel of real tube amps, with 300+ models offering an impressive range of clean, “edge of breakup”, and everything from warm, touch-sensitive overdrive to face-melting modern distortion.

The FM3 also includes the entire speaker cab impulse response (“IR”) collection from the Axe-Fx III, with a stunning 2,200+ “Factory” choices and 1,024 “User” locations to store custom sounds from free or commercial producers. Firmware 7, now in public beta, brings new DynaCab™ capabilities — and more — to the FM3 Mk II Turbo!

In comparison to the original FM3, the new MKII TURBO offers 10+% more DSP, allowing for more complex presets that would exceed the limits of the older version. It also adds new larger footswitch mini-displays. All other features and specs are the same as those on the standard FM3.

As a multi-effects unit, FM3 truly excels. It includes a superb selection of Fractal Audio’s state-of-the-art effect algorithms. All of the essentials and many exciting innovations are on board: dazzling drive pedals, dozens of delays, reverbs, compressors, EQs, phasers, flangers and other modulation effects, a looper, and much more.

The FM3 also features 4×4 USB Audio capability for both Mac and PC. This lets the FM3 double as the hub of a portable recording studio for playback, recording, re-amping, and more.

The FM3 is an extremely flexible and versatile foot controller with switch and layout capabilities based on our FC Controllers. Each footswitch has its own mini LCD display to show the function of the switch, plus a variable color LED ring which shows the category and status of the switch. Those who wish for more footswitches can use FASLINK™ to connect one or two FC-6 or FC-12 controllers. These integrate seamlessly with onboard switches and also offer additional switch/pedal jacks.

Whether you want the pure simplicity of a great guitar straight in to a classic amp, or to venture into totally unexplored sonic territory, the FM3 delivers the legendary Fractal Audio experience — and fits easily into a backpack.

10+% more DSP power than the standard FM3.
Durable steel chassis with protective endcaps designed to withstand the rigors of touring.

Three onboard “SSS” foot switches are quiet and reliable, with no mechanical contacts to fail.
FM3 uses the “FC” system of switches and layouts for extreme flexibility and versatility including 8+1 layouts, per-preset switches, and more.
Two pedal jacks each allow connecting 1-2 external switches or 1 expression pedal like the Fractal Audio EV-1 or EV-2.
Input 1 is ultra-low noise, with a 1/4” mono Instrument input featuring “Secret Sauce IV” for optimized signal from your guitar or bass.
Output 1 is Stereo, with Balanced XLR jacks, plus a stereo headphone out.
Stereo Input 2 and Stereo Output 2 can be used together as an FX loop, or individually as aux in/out for a range of flexible setups including 4CM, FRFR+Guitar Speaker backline, and more.

Which one is better is a difficult question, but Anasounds actually made a number of FET-based phase shifters, and after a comparative study, chose OTA.

Phase Lag allows you to create modern modulations that sweep across the frequency band you play. A low RATE gives a spatial expanse, and a high RATE gives a vibrato tone. Phase Lag is a 4-stage phase shifter, a pedal that has been tested many times. We paid particular attention to the volume, and designed it so that the volume would not drop too much by passing through the effect. The Anasounds logo indicator flashes in time with the RATE setting to instantly see your current setting. In addition, eight DIP switches can be installed inside to create vibe, vibrato, and tremolo effects from the phase shifter.">

Unique blend of 4 balanced armatures and 2 electrostatic tweeters in luscious harmony.

Meticulously Handcrafted
ADV. M5-6D in-ear monitors are expertly handcrafted using only the bespoke and highest grade components. Each unit goes through a specific set of procedure that includes 3D printing, hand-poured mould, grinding, laser-cutting, sanding and polishing. This meticulous production procedure requires 4-6 weeks of lead-time from preparation of the material to the final assembly. Once assembled, every M5-6D goes through a rigorous quality control process by the master technician, before finally getting approved and packaged.

Proprietary Hybrid Driver Technology
The M5-6D utilizes a proprietary-tuned blend of balanced armature drivers and the latest electrostatic tweeters to express audio in an unconventional fashion. One deciding characteristic of M5-6D is its incredible bass response with a set of dedicated woofers which is intimate and powerful – ideal for rock, pop and live music to accentuate the realistic and raw soundstage. The electrostatic tweeters bring out the micro-detail so you never miss the treble nuance under the bass. The resulting audio is powerful, sibilance-free and intimate listening experience that is completely unique and distinctive.

Designed to Fit You
The M5-6D is crafted with medical-grade acrylic, which is one of the safest material to use for a wearable device that comes in contact with your skin. Universal version of M5-6D is ergonomically designed after studying the shape of thousands of custom in-ear monitors. We’ve taken a common denominator from all the different ear shape, and morphed them into the universal shape it is now. Furthermore, the M5-6D is also offered in custom-fit, crafted to fit only your ear, should you decide to send us your ear impression.

Interchangeable 2-pin Silver-Plated Copper Cable
Included premium quad-braided silver-plated copper cable with a 3.5mm gold-plated plug uses 2-pin (0.78mm) termination that allows the cable and the monitors to be easily detachable.">

The proprietary PHPC (Pressurized High-Purity Carbon) driver used in the M5-TWS consists of the ultra-thin pressurized diamond-like carbon layer diaphragm which is both extremely rigid and light-weight, combined with the high-mass pure copper moving coil that maximizes the vibration stroke of the diaphragm. This unique pairing results in an improved overall resolution of the audio output from its 6.1mm diameter driver. M5-TWS is then delicately tuned to resemble Harman target curve using our proprietary acoustic filters and precise driver placement relative to your eardrum. Resulting audio is high-fidelity unlike any true wireless earbuds that came before it.

World’s First 3D-printed Housing
The M5-TWS is the world’s first true wireless earbuds that are crafted using the latest 3D-printing technology. Its totally ergonomic housing is designed based on 50,000+ actual ear impression data our partners and we collected over the years to ensure maximum compatibility and comfort. Its complex contours that resemble the actual in-ear shape could only be achieved by implementing the 3D-printing technique over the traditional mould tooling method.

CNC Aluminum Premium Charging Case
The M5-TWS features a premium CNC-machined and anodized aluminum charging case with USB-C charging port. The case has a easy-slide lid that is designed for one-hand operation, which allows a quick access to the earbuds on-the-go.

Automatic Pairing, Intuitive Touch-Control
The M5-TWS automatically turns on, enters pairing mode and turns off when you are done using it. Touch gesture control allows seamless operation of M5-TWS and provide fluid and unobstructed user-experience.

All Day Battery Life
The M5-TWS can play music up to 32-hour of all day use with its charging case. Single charge of earbuds is good for 9-hour continuous music playing. Combined with quick-charging, the M5-TWS is your ideal all-day portable music companion.

APTX / AAC High Resolution Codec Support
The M5-TWS implements the latest Qualcomm QCC3020 chipset, enabling APTX / AAC codec for high resolution music playback, and streamlining the pairing protocol that eliminates the need to reset the device for connection issues.">

The highs sound thick and really sing, while the lows are warm and buttery, giving you a pickup that is very sensitive to pick attack.

The Alnico 2 Pro bridge humbucker’s highs are articulate and smooth, and the lows are warm and spongy. Combined with a high gain tube amp, the overdriven tone is expressive and soulful. For over 25 years Slash has been the champion of this pickup and used them exclusively on Appetite for Destruction, which has gone on to become the biggest selling debut album of all time.">

Whether you’re replacing a defective switch, building a new instrument, or just in the market for an upgrade, DiMarzio’s CRL switches are an improvement that you will both hear and feel.

Black and white switch tips are included, along with two nickel-plated Phillips-head mounting screws.">

With just this one powerful switch, any number of switching options can be achieved — from simple pickup selection to phase reversal, coil splitting, and pickup selection or blower switch options (routing around a volume or tone pot and direct to the output jack)

 

Shaft diameter is standard 3/8”, so it can directly retrofit most standard USA Fender® and Gibson® volume and tone pot holes. The threaded shaft is 15/32” (11.906 mm) in height. Two nuts, a finish washer, and a sawtooth lock washer are included for easy installation.">
